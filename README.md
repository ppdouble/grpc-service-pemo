## 1. add common dependencies for grpc project

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
            <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
            <version>3.11.4</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
            <artifactId>grpc-netty-shaded</artifactId>
            <version>1.27.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
            <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
            <version>1.27.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
            <artifactId>grpc-stub</artifactId>
            <version>1.27.0</version>
        </dependency>
```

## 2. add plugins to convert protobuf file to java.

Those java code are like interfaces of services which will be implemented. 

### 2.1 the compiler which convert prototype files to java files

```xml
                            <outputTarget>
                                <type>grpc-java</type>
                                <pluginArtifact>io.grpc:protoc-gen-grpc-java:1.15.0</pluginArtifact>
                                <outputDirectory>src/main/java</outputDirectory>
                            </outputTarget>
```
### 2.2 where to find the generated java files
```xml
                            <outputTarget>
                                <type>java</type>
                                <outputDirectory>src/main/java</outputDirectory>
                            </outputTarget>
```

### 2.3 where to find prototype files
```xml
                            <inputDirectories>
                                <include>src/main/resources</include>
                            </inputDirectories>
```

## 3. create protobuf file

The proto file which will be treated as a service interface after converted to java file

`syntex = "proto3"`

The output java file name, say `User.java`

`option java_outer_classname = "User";`

java package name

`option java_package = "nd.pemo.grpc";`

define service, e.g. service interface. You should implement this interface to process the service.

`service user {}`

define method with return type rpc(Remote Procedure Call)

`rpc login(LoginRequest) returns (APIResponse);`

define message format that will be exchanged between client and server

```protobuf
message LoginRequest {
  string username = 1;  // the number is used by grpc framework for the protocol buffers for the backward compatibility
  string password = 2;
}
```

## 4. implementing interface e.g. service

`public class UserService extends userGrpc.userImplBase {}`

### 4.1 implementing apis

`interface StreamObserver<V>` Receives notifications from an observable stream of messages.
> It is used by both the client stubs and service implementations for sending or receiving stream messages.

> For outgoing messages, a StreamObserver is provided by the GRPC library to the application. 
> 
> For incoming messages, the application implements the StreamObserver and passes it to the GRPC library for receiving.

> Since individual StreamObservers are not thread-safe, if multiple threads will be writing to a StreamObserver concurrently, the application must synchronize calls.


```java
@Override
public void login(User.LoginRequest request, StreamObserver<User.APIResponse> responseObserver) {}

```


receive message

`User.LoginRequest request` receive messages e.g. parameters or data.

create the response
`User.APIResponse.Builder response = User.APIResponse.newBuilder();`

and construct the response based on message format
`responseBuilder.setResponseCode(1).setResponsemessage("Login Success");`

wrap the response object inside the streamObserver. 
And send the streamObserver back to client.
So that the client knows how to read response streamObserver object
and extract the response.

`responseStreamObserver.onNext(response.build());`

`onNext(V value)` Receives a value from the stream.

> Can be called many times but is never called after onError(Throwable) or onCompleted() are called.

> Unary calls must invoke onNext at most once. 

> Clients may invoke onNext at most once for server streaming calls, 
> but may receive many onNext callbacks. 

> Servers may invoke onNext at most once for client streaming calls, 
> but may receive many onNext callbacks.

Finally, closing the connection between server api and client 
by using `responseStreamObserver.onCompleted()`.

## 5. create server

use the **server builder** which is part of grpc library

setting the port and making the service embedded inside the server

`ServerBuilder.forPort(9091).addService(new UserService()).build();`

using `awaitTermination()` to keep server alive

## 6. Testing Server. 
Checking whether grpc server is running.

testing with BloomRPC Client App (It's like postman tool.)

 - import `userproto.proto` file to BloomPRC.
 - setting server port `localhostï¼š9091`
 - sending request to service (e.g. interface) including login api and logout api with corresponding message format (the concepts, service, api, interface are similar in this context)
